# Predictive Control Based on the ARIMAX Model

## Project Overview

In the field of engineering and automation, predictive control is emerging as a crucial discipline, revolutionizing the way systems are managed and optimized. This project aims to conduct an in-depth exploration of the topic "Predictive Control Based on the ARIMAX Model" through a three-step approach:

## Steps Involved

### 1. Literature Review
Through extensive research, our objective is to understand the fundamental concepts and recent advancements related to predictive control based on the ARIMAX model. This will involve reviewing academic papers, articles, and other resources to build a solid theoretical foundation.

### 2. MATLAB Simulation
We will apply our knowledge by performing simulations in the MATLAB environment. This will involve implementing the predictive control algorithm and illustrating its functioning through a concrete simulation example, showcasing how the ARIMAX model can be used in practice.

### 3. Algorithm Transfer to Arduino
In the final phase, we will carry out a practical implementation of the ARIMAX model for predictive control by transferring the studied algorithm to an Arduino board. This step aims to solidify the theoretical concepts in a real-world context, demonstrating the effectiveness of predictive control in an automated system.
